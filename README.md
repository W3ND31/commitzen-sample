## Commitizen example

To run this example you need to run `yarn prepare`

After this, after `git commit`, commitizen will ask you what kind of commit is and other things based on [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)


## Configuring questions and options

On `.cz-config.js` and `commitlint.config.js` you can configure the questions, the descriptions of them, if them have any options or not and other things using [cz-customizable](https://github.com/leoforfree/cz-customizable) and [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
